## [1.3.0]
### Changed 
- BREAKING CHANGE: Keystore and certificate are provided through File type parameter. It gives more flexibility for different environments (e.g. Spring Boot). Migration to this version: change keystore and certificate parameters to File: keyStoreFile, viispSignCertificateFile. When using Spring it is enough to just change property names.

## [1.2.1]
### Changed 
- Signature validation adapted for jre17. Jre 17 has secureValidation enabled by default. VIISP signature uses old RSA-SHA1, so secureValidation is disabled now.
